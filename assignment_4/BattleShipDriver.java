Assignment 4

For COMP 248 Section ECBX â€“ Fall 2020

This program is a battleship game that prints the new grid after the user inputs the position where they want to
shoot. This version of battleship has boats that are only 1x1 and also contain grenades that skips the turn of the
player that shoots them. All of the user inputs can only be a character followed by an integer from 0-9
(example : A4), otherwise the code will break.

In the main class, the program first creates a grid where the game is going to be played. It then prompts the user to
enter the coordinates where they want to place their objects. After, it randomly places the computer's objects. Then, it
starts the game and prompts the user to enter a location they want to shoot a rocket at. Once the player's turn is over,
it moves on to the computer's turn where it randomly shoots on the grid, not shooting at its own objects. This goes on
until one of the players has all of their ships shot down. Once this happens, the opponent of that player is declared
the winner.
